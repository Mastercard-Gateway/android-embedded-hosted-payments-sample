This project is an example of how to show Simplify's Hosted Payment in a page to collect a Card Token then performa redirect that can be consumed by a WebView in an Android App. Hosted Payment will perform 3DS 1.0 Authentication if enabled for the cardholder. The Card Token can then be used to complete a Payment using any of Simplify's server-side SDKs.The example PHP is hostedPayment.php when Hosted Payment returns a card token to the page the WebView is redirected to

    simplify://cardToken?=<Card Token>

The embed WebView listens for the redirect for the simplify:// scheme and can the parse the URL for the card token.
